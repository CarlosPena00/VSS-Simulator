This software was developed to help with the competitors of this category (IEEE VSSS) to construct the behaviour of the robot without the need of the physical hardware. Everything developed in this simulator, like the team strategy, will work in real world too.

This software include a modified Bullet Physics Library. The btRaycastVehicle.cpp was rewritted to obbey this robot kinematic's.
